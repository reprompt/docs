# Confidence Scores

Learn how to interpret confidence scores and match quality indicators in the Place Match API.

## Confidence Score Ranges

| Score Range | Match Type | Description | Action |
|-------------|------------|-------------|---------|
| 0.8 - 1.0 | High Confidence | Very likely the same place | Auto-merge recommended |
| 0.6 - 0.8 | Medium Confidence | Possible match | Manual review suggested |
| 0.3 - 0.6 | Low Confidence | Unlikely match | Investigate if needed |
| 0.0 - 0.3 | No Match | Different places | No action needed |

## Scoring Factors

The confidence score is calculated using multiple factors:

### Name Similarity (40% weight)
- Exact match: 1.0
- High similarity: 0.8-0.9  
- Moderate similarity: 0.5-0.7
- Low similarity: 0.0-0.4

### Geographic Proximity (30% weight)
- Same coordinates: 1.0
- Within 50m: 0.9
- Within 200m: 0.7
- Within 1km: 0.4
- Beyond 1km: 0.0-0.3

### Address Matching (20% weight)
- Exact address: 1.0
- Same street, different number: 0.6
- Same area/neighborhood: 0.4
- Different addresses: 0.0-0.2

### Additional Attributes (10% weight)
- Phone number match: +0.1
- Website match: +0.1
- Business hours match: +0.05

## Example Confidence Breakdown

```json
{
  "candidate_id": "place_123",
  "confidence_score": 0.87,
  "match_type": "high_confidence",
  "score_breakdown": {
    "name_similarity": 0.92,
    "geographic_proximity": 0.85, 
    "address_match": 0.80,
    "phone_match": true,
    "website_match": false
  },
  "reasons": [
    "Name similarity: 92% (Joe's Pizza vs Joe's Pizza Restaurant)",
    "Geographic proximity: 15 meters apart",
    "Address match: Same street number and name",
    "Phone number matches exactly"
  ]
}
```

## Tuning Confidence Thresholds

Adjust the `min_confidence` parameter based on your use case:

### Conservative Matching (min_confidence: 0.9)
- **Use for**: Critical data merging, financial records
- **Result**: Fewer matches, higher precision
- **Trade-off**: May miss some valid matches

### Balanced Matching (min_confidence: 0.7) 
- **Use for**: General deduplication, data cleaning
- **Result**: Good balance of precision and recall
- **Trade-off**: Recommended default

### Aggressive Matching (min_confidence: 0.5)
- **Use for**: Initial screening, broad similarity detection  
- **Result**: More matches, requires manual review
- **Trade-off**: Higher false positive rate

## Best Practices

1. **Start Conservative**: Begin with higher thresholds and adjust down
2. **Review Medium Confidence**: Always manually review 0.6-0.8 matches
3. **Consider Context**: Adjust thresholds based on data quality and use case
4. **Monitor Results**: Track false positives/negatives to optimize thresholds
5. **Use Reasons**: Leverage the `reasons` field to understand match quality
