# Authentication

The Place Match API uses API key authentication. All requests must include your API key in the Authorization header.

## Getting Your API Key

1. Sign up at [app.repromptai.com](https://app.repromptai.com)
2. Navigate to the API Keys section
3. Generate a new API key for Place Match

## Using Your API Key

Include your API key in the `Authorization` header of every request:

```bash
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY
```

## Example Request

```bash
curl -X POST "https://api.repromptai.com/v1/placematch/match" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer sk-pm-1234567890abcdef" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"source_place": {...}}'
```

## Security Best Practices

- **Keep your API key secure** - Never expose it in client-side code
- **Use environment variables** - Store your API key in environment variables
- **Rotate keys regularly** - Generate new keys periodically
- **Monitor usage** - Track API usage in your dashboard

## Rate Limits

- **Standard tier**: 100 requests per minute
- **Pro tier**: 1,000 requests per minute
- **Enterprise**: Custom limits available

Rate limit headers are included in every response:
- `X-RateLimit-Limit`: Your rate limit
- `X-RateLimit-Remaining`: Remaining requests
- `X-RateLimit-Reset`: When the limit resets
