Reprompt agent generates a deep research KYB PDF report and JSON output including risk assessment, executive summary, and individual risk flags.

## How It Works

**Inputs:** A business name and address. Optionally, the name of the person requesting the report and a tax identification number (EIN).

**Processing:** The agent autonomously researches the business across Secretary of State filings, IRS records, USPS address validation, watchlist databases, and the open web. Reports typically complete in under 3 minutes.

**Output:** A structured report with:

- **Business status** -- Verified or unverified
- **Executive summary** -- Key findings at a glance, designed for fast decisioning without reviewing the full report
- **Risk scores** -- Fraud safety, loan approval, and Reprompt validation scores

And detailed verification across:

- **Entity verification** -- Business name, address, source classification (authoritative vs non-authoritative)
- **Core business facts** -- Formation state, entity type, formation date, filing ID, SOS standing, TIN match status
- **Address verification** -- USPS deliverability, property type (commercial/residential), CMRA, vacancy, risk level
- **Secretary of State filings** -- Active/inactive registrations, standing, jurisdiction, registered agent, and detailed filing info
- **Insights** -- Per-section status rollups (SOS, TIN match, formation state, revenue standing, office address, people, watchlist, business name)
- **Business names** -- Legal name and DBA names found across sources
- **Online presence** -- Active websites and social media profiles
- **People** -- Officers with roles
- **Watchlist screening** -- Company and person screening results
- **News and adverse media** -- Recent news coverage and adverse media mentions
- **Certifications** -- Industry certifications including non-government associations
