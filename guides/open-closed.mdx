title: "POI Status - Open Closed"
description: "This page explains how Reprompt determines whether a place (POI) is open, permanently closed, or has no discernible internet presence."

## What this attribute represents

Reprompt returns a status with supporting evidence and confidence. The core fields you’ll see are:

- `is_permanently_closed` (boolean): whether the business is determined to be permanently closed.
- `cannot_find_business` (boolean): whether we could not find any credible internet presence for the business at all.
- `reasoning` (string): concise, user‑readable explanation with referenced sources.
- `confidence` (enum): one of `VERY_HIGH`, `HIGH`, `MEDIUM`, `LOW`.

We also expose a derived display state:
- `Open`
- `Closed` (i.e., permanently closed)
- `No Internet Presence` (cannot find the business online)

### Definitions at a glance

- Open: Recent, credible evidence the exact business name is operating (or has relocated nearby under the same name).
- Closed: Explicit closure signals from credible sources, or replacement by a different business name at the same address. US-only nuance may rely on trusted aggregate business data.
- No Internet Presence: No credible reference tying the exact name to a plausible location match; we skip open/closed classification.

<Info>
We do not surface a “Temporarily Closed” state. When the only signal is “temporary closure” or general inactivity, we normalize to `is_permanently_closed = true` with `confidence = LOW` for downstream simplicity. See [Normalization behavior](### Normalization behavior) below.

### How Reprompt decides

1) Internet presence check
    - We first search for credible evidence that the business exists online using exact name checks plus reasonable address/location context.
    - If nothing credible is found, we return `cannot_find_business = true`

2) Open vs Permanently Closed classification
    - If internet presence exists, we assess operating status using country‑aware rules and a strict source reliability policy.

### Source trust policy

- Unreliable (never used as proof): Google Maps/Places, Waze, MapQuest, and any org‑specific excluded domains.
- Generally credible:
  - Official websites and first‑party channels (brand’s site, official social media).
  - Government/registries and recognized business datasets.
  - Established review platforms (e.g., Yelp, TripAdvisor, Foursquare).
  - Listings and tours:
    - First‑party/official listings (e.g., a builder’s own inventory/model pages) are strong signals.
    - Third‑party tours (e.g., YouTube/realtor/influencer) are usable when corroborated by at least one additional credible source (review, listing, or official channel).

- Recency guidance used in practice:
  - “Recent activity” typically means within the last 24 months.
  - Activity older than ~36 months is considered stale; on its own it is not strong evidence of being open.
  - For US businesses, trusted aggregate data can increase confidence even with fewer recent public signals.

<Note>
Reasoning cites only credible sources and omits excluded/unreliable domains. Third‑party media is treated as supporting evidence and is stronger with corroboration.
</Note>

## Definitions and conditions

### Open
  - Exact business name plus plausible address/location context is found, with recent activity (site updates, reviews, delivery listings, working phone, or recent official/first‑party social posts).
  - If the exact business name is active at a different nearby address (relocation), we treat it as Open and explain the move.
  - Ambiguous cases without contradictory evidence generally bias to Open with lower confidence, especially outside the US.

### Permanently Closed
  - Explicit permanent closure evidence from credible sources (e.g., “permanently closed/out of business,” official announcements, bankruptcy/liquidation, demolition/redevelopment).
  - A different business name is operating at the same address with no current evidence for the original brand → original is Permanently Closed.
  - US nuance: trusted aggregate US business data indicating closure can be sufficient; confidence reflects how directly verifiable the evidence is in public sources.

### No Internet Presence
  - No credible reference for the exact name with any plausible location match.
  - We set `cannot_find_business = true` and skip open/closed classification.

### Normalization behavior 

- “Temporarily closed,” “inactive,” or ambiguous inactivity signals are normalized to:
  - `is_permanently_closed = true`
  - `confidence = LOW`
- Rationale: many downstream systems require a binary closed flag. The low confidence communicates that the signal is weak or non‑final.

<Warning>
Do not treat `LOW` confidence Closed as an authoritative permanent closure. Use it as a “soft closure”/review queue. See usage guidance below.
</Warning>



## When Reprompt cannot determine

- Lack of evidence: Without explicit closure evidence, we prefer Open (with lower confidence) rather than inferring closure from silence.
- Conflicting signals: We still return a decision, but confidence drops.
- The practical “cannot determine” you’ll see is “No Internet Presence” when we cannot verify the business exists online.



### Industry nuances

- New construction / model homes (builders/developments)
  - First‑party builder listings tying a specific address to a model home, plus recent tours/reviews, indicate Open (active sales/marketing counts as operational activity).
  - Third‑party videos alone are insufficient; corroborate with first‑party listings, official pages, or credible reviews.

- Healthcare and regulated entities
  - Registry entries (e.g., NPI) with very old update dates are weak by themselves. Treat as supporting context, not closure proof, unless combined with stronger signals.



## Confidence scoring (how to use it)

- VERY_HIGH / HIGH: Strong, specific, recent evidence, or trusted US aggregate data without contradictions.
- MEDIUM: Reasonable evidence with some uncertainty or older sources.
- LOW: Ambiguous, conflicting, inactive, or “temporary closure” signals; normalization may apply.


## Examples

Open (relocation or active marketing)
```json
{
  "is_permanently_closed": false,
  "cannot_find_business": false,
  "confidence": "HIGH",
  "reasoning": "Corroborated recent activity from credible sources; active operations or sales/marketing are present."
}
```

Permanently Closed (replacement at same address)
```json
{
  "is_permanently_closed": true,
  "cannot_find_business": false,
  "confidence": "HIGH",
  "reasoning": "Different business name currently operates at the same address; no current evidence for the original brand."
}
```

No Internet Presence
```json
{
  "is_permanently_closed": false,
  "cannot_find_business": true,
  "confidence": "MEDIUM",
  "reasoning": "No credible references for the exact name with plausible location context."
}
```

Closed (normalized from temporary/inactivity)
```json
{
  "is_permanently_closed": true,
  "cannot_find_business": false,
  "confidence": "LOW",
  "reasoning": "Signals suggest temporary closure or general inactivity; normalized to Closed with LOW confidence."
}
```
