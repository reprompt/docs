title: "Place Status - Open/Closed"
description: "Enrich whether a place is open, permanently closed, or has no discernible internet presence."

## Overview

Reprompt determines business status and returns:

- `is_permanently_closed` (boolean): whether the business is permanently closed
- `cannot_find_business` (boolean): whether we found no credible internet presence
- `reasoning` (string): explanation with referenced sources
- `confidence` (enum): `VERY_HIGH`, `HIGH`, `MEDIUM`, `LOW`

## Status Definitions

**Open**: Recent, credible evidence the business is operating or has relocated nearby under the same name.

**Permanently Closed**: Explicit closure signals from credible sources, or replacement by a different business at the same address.

**No Internet Presence**: No credible reference for the exact name with plausible location context.

<Info>
"Temporarily closed" or inactive signals are normalized to `is_permanently_closed = true` with `confidence = LOW` for downstream simplicity.
</Info>

## How We Decide

1. **Internet presence check**: Search for credible evidence the business exists online
2. **Status classification**: If found, assess operating status using source reliability policy

### Source Trust Policy

**Unreliable** (never used): Google Maps/Places, Waze, MapQuest

**Credible sources**:
- Official websites and first-party channels
- Government registries and business datasets  
- Established review platforms (Yelp, TripAdvisor, Foursquare)
- First-party listings (builder inventory, model pages)
- Third-party content when corroborated by credible sources

**Recency**: Recent activity = last 24 months. Activity older than ~36 months is considered stale.

## Confidence Levels

- **VERY_HIGH/HIGH**: Strong, recent evidence or trusted US aggregate data
- **MEDIUM**: Reasonable evidence with some uncertainty or older sources  
- **LOW**: Ambiguous, conflicting, or "temporary closure" signals

<Warning>
Do not treat `LOW` confidence Closed as authoritative permanent closure. Use as "soft closure" for review.
</Warning>


## Examples

Open (relocation or active marketing)
```json
{
  "is_permanently_closed": false,
  "cannot_find_business": false,
  "confidence": "HIGH",
  "reasoning": "Corroborated recent activity from credible sources; active operations or sales/marketing are present."
}
```

Permanently Closed (replacement at same address)
```json
{
  "is_permanently_closed": true,
  "cannot_find_business": false,
  "confidence": "HIGH",
  "reasoning": "Different business name currently operates at the same address; no current evidence for the original brand."
}
```

No Internet Presence
```json
{
  "is_permanently_closed": false,
  "cannot_find_business": true,
  "confidence": "MEDIUM",
  "reasoning": "No credible references for the exact name with plausible location context."
}
```

Closed (normalized from temporary/inactivity)
```json
{
  "is_permanently_closed": true,
  "cannot_find_business": false,
  "confidence": "LOW",
  "reasoning": "Signals suggest temporary closure or general inactivity; normalized to Closed with LOW confidence."
}
```
