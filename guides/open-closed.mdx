title: "Place Status - Open/Closed"
description: "Enrich whether a place is open, permanently closed, or has no discernible internet presence."

## Overview

Reprompt determines business status and returns a structured `open_closed_status` with:

- `status` (enum): One of `"Open"`, `"Closed"`, `"Temporarily Closed"`, or `"No Internet Presence"`
- `reasoning` (string): Explanation with referenced sources
- `confidence` (enum): `VERY_HIGH`, `HIGH`, `MEDIUM`, `LOW`, or `NONE`

## Status Values

```python
class OpenClosedStatus(str, Enum):
    NO_INTERNET_PRESENCE = "No Internet Presence"
    OPEN = "Open"
    CLOSED = "Closed"
    TEMPORARILY_CLOSED = "Temporarily Closed"
```

### Status Definitions

**Open**: Recent, credible evidence the business is operating or has relocated nearby under the same name.

**Closed**: Explicit closure signals from credible sources, or replacement by a different business at the same address.

**Temporarily Closed**: Business appears temporarily closed but may reopen (COVID closures, renovations, etc.).

**No Internet Presence**: No credible reference for the exact name with plausible location context.

## Usage Example

To enrich a place with open/closed status information:

```bash cURL
curl -X POST \
  'https://reprompt--reprompt-fastapi-fastapi-app.us-west.modal.run/{your_org_slug}/place_enrichment/enrich' \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer {YOUR_API_KEY}' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
