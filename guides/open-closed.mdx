## Overview

Reprompt determines business status and returns a structured `open_closed_status` with:

- `status` (enum): One of `"Open"`, `"Closed"`, `"Temporarily Closed"`, or `"No Internet Presence"`
- `reasoning` (string): Explanation with referenced sources
- `confidence` (enum): `VERY_HIGH`, `HIGH`, `MEDIUM`, `LOW`, or `NONE`

## Status Values

```python
class OpenClosedStatus(str, Enum):
    NO_INTERNET_PRESENCE = "No Internet Presence"
    OPEN = "Open"
    CLOSED = "Closed"
    TEMPORARILY_CLOSED = "Temporarily Closed"
```

## Usage Example

To enrich a place with open/closed status information:

```bash cURL
curl -X POST \
  'https://reprompt--reprompt-fastapi-fastapi-app.us-west.modal.run/{your_org_slug}/place_enrichment/enrich' \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer {YOUR_API_KEY}' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
    "inputs": {
      "place_id": "my_place_123",
      "name": "Joe'\''s Pizza",
      "latitude": 40.7359,
      "longitude": -73.9911,
      "full_address": "7 Carmine St, New York, NY 10014"
    },
    "attributes": ["closed_permanently"]
  }'
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "place_id": "my_place_123",
  "outputs": {
    "closed_permanently": {
      "status": "Open",
      "confidence": "HIGH",
      "reasoning": "Recent activity confirmed from multiple credible sources; business appears to be operating normally."
    }
  }
}
```

### Determining Status

#### No Internet Presence
- **Places are defined as having no internet presence if**:
  - Web sources have no exact or near exact business name match and
  - Web sources have no near partial address match tied to the business name

#### Permanently Closed vs Temporarily Closed vs Open

- **Permanently closed**: Reprompt will return Closed if there is evidence of:
  - Explicit closure signals from official first-party web or social sources (Business website, business official social media page, etc.)
  - Explicit closure signals from multiple corroborated unofficial web sources (public news articles, goverment web portals, public aggregator websites, etc.)
  - Specifically for businesses with a customer-facing storefront: Lack of official web or social presence and lack of corroborated 3rd party sources will mark the business as permanently closed. For instance, a Joe's Pizza in New York City that has no official first-party presence and is only listed on MapQuest and Better Business Bureau from 2009 will be marked as permanently closed without an explicit signal, based on absense of information from up to date sources.

- **Temporarily Closed**: Requires official temporary closure signals from official web or social sources

- **Bias**: There is a high bar for marking a business as permanently closed. The agent will bias towards Open if there is sufficient evidence of existence and operation from up to date web sources.

Specific cases:
  - **Minor name variations**: Slight variations in the name will be treated as the same place. For example, "Joe's Pizza" and "Joseph Hot Wings and Pizza" at the same address will be treated as the same place. A closure announcement of "Joe's Pizza" will impact "Joseph Hot Wings and Pizza"
  - **Significant name variations**: If the name is significantly different, the agent will treat the business as a different place. For example, "Joe's Pizza" and "Mystic Pizza" at the same address will be treated as different places. A closure announcement of "Joe's Pizza" will not impact "Mystic Pizza"


Example cases:
- Place: Joe's Pizza, 7 carmine st, new york, ny
- Status: Open
- Reasoning: Joe's Pizza has a significant digital presence with an official first-party website (joespizzanyc.com) and official social media with posts in the last 6 months. They are mentioned by multiple news articles and listed on multiple review aggregator websites. The agent finds no evidence of closure or temporary closure.


- Place: Iza Ramen, 237 Fillmore St, San Francisco, CA
- Status: Closed
- Reasoning: Iza Ramen has news articles mentioned closure of the business during COVID. The business has official social media with no mention of the closure. There is no evidence of reopening or that the closure is temporary. The agent marks the business as permanently closed.


- Place: Terry's Donuts, 712 steiner st, Seattle, WA
- Status: Closed
- Reasoning: Terry's Donuts has no official web or social presence. It is not listed on review aggregator websites. It's only listed on Better Business Bureau from 2009. The agent marks the business as permanently closed without an explicit signal, based on absense of information from up to date sources. Note that this is a special case where the business has a customer-facing storefront but no recent official web or social presence.

- Place: Robertson Commercial Construction, 701 Power Line Rd, Winter Haven, FL
- Status: Open
- Reasoning: Robertson Commercial Construction has an official website which lists its office address as 701 Power Line Rd, Winter Haven, FL, and a county filing from 2021. It has very little internet presence otherwise. The agent marks the business as open with medium confidence since this is not a customer-facing business.
