## Place Type Classification

The `placetype` field categorizes the business into one of four primary types: `accommodation`, `restaurant`, `attraction`, or `CANT_VERIFY`. This high-level classification determines the fundamental nature of the business and drives the overall user experience.

### Fallback Behavior

When sufficient evidence is unavailable or inconsistent, the enrichment returns placetype `CANT_VERIFY` with `subtype_id` 0 and `subtype` "CANT_VERIFY".
