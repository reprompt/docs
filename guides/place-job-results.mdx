## Overview

When you retrieve jobs from the batch endpoints, each job includes inputs, outputs, reasoning, and confidence scores. This guide explains those sections and provides a clean example.

- **Batch docs**: [Batch Processing](/guides/batch-processing)
- **API reference**: See the Place Enrichment Batch endpoints in the API reference for your version.

## Sections

- **Inputs**: What you submitted for a place. These are the fields we use to locate and enrich the place (e.g., name, coordinates, address, country).
- **Outputs**: The enriched attributes we found, such as website, phone, opening_hours, categories, ratings, and review counts.
- **Reasoning**: Brief, structured notes explaining how each attribute was determined (when available).
- **Confidence scores**: A per-attribute confidence level reflecting the reliability of the result.

## Example Response

The example below removes internal processing metadata and focuses on what your application will typically use.

```json
{
  "jobs": [
    {
      "place_id": "place_123",
      "status": "completed",
      "job_metadata": {
        "last_enriched": "2025-03-10T15:35:00Z",
        "country_code": "US",
        "attribute_status": {
          "website": "RUN",
          "phoneNumbers": "RUN",
          "openingHours": "RUN",
          "categories": "RUN"
        }
      },
      "inputs": {
        "id": "place_123",
        "name": "Joe's Pizza",
        "latitude": 40.7359,
        "longitude": -73.9911,
        "full_address": "7 Carmine St, New York, NY 10014",
        "country_code": "US"
      },
      "outputs": {
        "website": "https://www.joespizzanyc.com",
        "phone": null,
        "opening_hours": { "Monday": "11:00-23:00", "Tuesday": "11:00-23:00" },
        "categories": ["restaurant", "pizza"],
        "average_rating": 4.5,
        "review_count": 1200
      },
      "reasoning": {
        "websites": "Structured reasoning…",
        "phone": "No phone found on official site.",
        "opening_hours": "Structured reasoning…",
        "categories": "Structured reasoning…"
      },
      "confidence_scores": {
        "website": "HIGH",
        "phone": "LOW",
        "opening_hours": "MEDIUM",
        "categories": "HIGH"
      }
    }
  ],
  "total": 1,
  "limit": 10000,
  "offset": 0
}
```

## Schemas

### Confidence Scores

Confidence levels indicate how reliable a given attribute is:

```python
class ConfidenceScore(str, Enum):
    VERY_HIGH = "VERY_HIGH"
    HIGH = "HIGH"
    MEDIUM = "MEDIUM"
    LOW = "LOW"
    NONE = "NONE"
```

- **VERY_HIGH/HIGH**: Safe to use directly
- **MEDIUM**: Generally reliable; consider validation for critical use cases
- **LOW**: Use with caution; may require manual review
- **NONE**: No reliable data found

### Attribute Statuses

Each attribute can include a processing status in `job_metadata.attribute_status` to indicate how enrichment proceeded:

```ts
export type AttributeStatus = 'RUN' | 'RUN_CONDITION_FAILED' | 'NOT_RUN' | 'ERROR'
```

- **RUN**: Enrichment was attempted (and completed); the attribute value may be present or null.
- **RUN_CONDITION_FAILED**: Skipped because preconditions were not met (e.g., missing inputs or failing filters).
- **NOT_RUN**: Not attempted (e.g., disabled, out of scope, or limits).
- **ERROR**: Attempted but failed due to an error.

Attributes that commonly include a status entry include `website`, `phoneNumbers`, `openingHours`, and `categories`.

## Next Steps

- Submit a batch following the [Batch Processing](/guides/batch-processing) guide, then poll for completion and retrieve results.
- Use the `confidence_scores` and `attribute_status` to drive QA workflows or manual review where needed.
