Know Your Business (KYB) is the process of verifying that a company is legitimate and safe to transact with. It is a standard requirement for onboarding in financial services, lending, partnerships, and regulated industries.

KYB typically requires analysts to manually check government registries, verify addresses, review directors and shareholders, screen against sanctions lists, and compile a risk assessment. The Reprompt UK KYB API automates this end-to-end for companies registered in the United Kingdom.

## How It Works

**Inputs:** A company name and address. Optionally, the name of the person requesting the report and a tax identification number.

**Processing:** The agent autonomously researches the business across UK government registries, global sanctions and PEP databases, address verification services, and the open web. Reports typically complete in under 3 minutes.

**Output:** A structured report covering:

- **Identity verification** -- Company registration status, entity type, incorporation date, jurisdiction, and SIC codes
- **Address verification** -- Registered address validation with precision level and red flags
- **Officers and directors** -- Current and former directors, secretaries, and other officers
- **Beneficial owners** -- Persons with Significant Control (PSCs) holding 25%+ ownership or voting rights
- **Filing health** -- Whether statutory accounts and confirmation statements are current or overdue
- **Charges** -- Outstanding loans, mortgages, and debentures registered against the company
- **Sanctions and PEP screening** -- Each entity (company, directors, beneficial owners) screened against global sanctions and politically exposed persons databases
- **Web intelligence** -- Adverse media and relevant web coverage

Every report includes a **risk score** (0-100) with a clear recommendation (pass, review, enhanced due diligence, or fail), and an **executive summary** of 3 to 5 key findings. The executive summary provides the most critical information at a glance -- designed to support fast decisioning without requiring a full review of the underlying data.

## Start a Report

### POST /kyb/report/start

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `business_name` | string | Yes | Legal or trading name of the business |
| `business_address` | string | Yes | Full address of the business |
| `person_submitting` | string | No | Name of the person requesting the report |
| `tax_identification_number` | string | No | Company tax ID |

```bash
curl -X POST "https://api.reprompt.io/kyb/report/start" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -d '{
    "business_name": "Revolut Ltd",
    "business_address": "7 Westferry Circus, Canary Wharf, London, E14 4HD"
  }'
```

```json
{
  "status": "processing",
  "report_id": "rpt_7f3a2b1c9d4e",
  "poll_url": "/kyb/report/rpt_7f3a2b1c9d4e",
  "stream_id": "rpt_7f3a2b1c9d4e",
  "channel": "rpt_7f3a2b1c9d4e",
  "event_name": "kyb:stream:event"
}
```

Use `report_id` to poll for results. For real-time progress, subscribe to the Pusher channel using `stream_id` and `event_name`.

## Poll for Results

### GET /kyb/report/{report_id}

```bash
curl "https://api.reprompt.io/kyb/report/rpt_7f3a2b1c9d4e" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY"
```

The response shape depends on the `status` field: `processing`, `completed`, or `error`.

When `status` is `completed`, the response includes the full `report` object and a `pdf_url` linking to a permanent PDF.

## What the Report Covers

Each completed report returns a `report` object containing:

| Section | What It Tells You |
|---|---|
| `identity_verification` | Registered name, company number, status, entity type, incorporation date, jurisdiction, and SIC codes |
| `registered_address` | Formatted address, verification status, precision level, and any red flags |
| `officers` | Current and former directors, secretaries, and other officers with appointment dates |
| `beneficial_owners` | Persons with Significant Control (PSCs) -- anyone controlling 25%+ of the company |
| `filing_health` | Whether accounts and confirmation statements are up to date or overdue |
| `charges` | Outstanding loans, mortgages, and debentures registered against the company |
| `sanctions_screening` | Per-entity screening against global sanctions lists and PEP databases |
| `web_intelligence` | Adverse media and web search results |
| `risk_assessment` | **Computed risk score (0-100) with signal breakdown and action recommendation** |
| `executive_summary` | **3-5 key findings -- the most important things to know at a glance** |

---

## Risk Assessment

Every report includes a server-computed risk score from 0 to 100. The score is deterministic -- it's calculated from the signals found during verification, not generated by the agent. This means the same underlying data always produces the same score.

### Risk Tiers

| Classification | Score Range | Recommendation |
|---|---|---|
| `LOW_RISK` | 0-20 | `PASS` -- low risk, proceed |
| `MEDIUM_RISK` | 21-45 | `REVIEW` -- manual review recommended |
| `HIGH_RISK` | 46-70 | `EDD` -- Enhanced Due Diligence required |
| `VERY_HIGH_RISK` | 71-100 | `FAIL` -- do not proceed |

### Risk Signals

The score is built from individual signals, each with a fixed point value. The `signal_breakdown` array shows exactly which signals fired and why.

| Signal | Points | Trigger Condition |
|---|---|---|
| `Company dissolved/liquidation` | 40 | Company status is dissolved, liquidation, or administration |
| `Sanctions hit` | 50 | Any entity matched on a sanctions list |
| `PEP hit` | 20 | Any person matched as a Politically Exposed Person |
| `No active directors` | 20 | Company has zero current directors |
| `Overdue accounts` | 15 | Annual accounts are past due |
| `Address not verified` | 15 | Address could not be independently verified |
| `No PSCs declared` | 15 | No Persons with Significant Control on record |
| `Overdue confirmation statement` | 10 | Confirmation statement is past due |
| `Low address precision` | 10 | Address matched to street or city level only |
| `No web presence` | 10 | Web searches found no meaningful results |
| `Company age < 1 year` | 10 | Incorporated less than 12 months ago |
| `Active charges` | 5 each (max 15) | Outstanding charges registered against company |
| `Single director` | 5 | Company has exactly one director |

The raw total can exceed 100 but the final score is capped at 100.

### Example

```json
{
  "score": 55,
  "classification": "HIGH_RISK",
  "recommendation": "EDD",
  "signal_breakdown": [
    { "signal": "Address not verified", "points": 15, "triggered": true },
    { "signal": "Sanctions hit", "points": 50, "triggered": true },
    { "signal": "Overdue accounts", "points": 15, "triggered": false },
    { "signal": "PEP hit", "points": 20, "triggered": false }
  ]
}
```

In this case, two signals fired (address unverified + sanctions match) for a total score of 65, placing the company in the `HIGH_RISK` tier with an `EDD` recommendation.

## Executive Summary

The executive summary is the fastest way to understand a report. It contains 3 to 5 key findings, each with a severity indicator and a plain-language explanation.

Each item has:

| Field | Description |
|---|---|
| `icon` | `check`, `warning`, or `critical` |
| `tone` | `green`, `yellow`, or `red` |
| `title` | Short finding title |
| `description` | Plain-language explanation |

### Example

```json
[
  {
    "icon": "critical",
    "tone": "red",
    "title": "Sanctions Match",
    "description": "Director Nikolay Storonsky matched on Ukraine NSDC sanctions list"
  },
  {
    "icon": "check",
    "tone": "green",
    "title": "Active & Compliant",
    "description": "Company is active with filings up to date"
  },
  {
    "icon": "warning",
    "tone": "yellow",
    "title": "Address Not Verified",
    "description": "Registered address could not be independently verified"
  }
]
```

Use the executive summary to power dashboards, notifications, or quick-glance UIs without parsing the full report.
