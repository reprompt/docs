## Input Place Schema

```python
{
  # Required
  "name": str,  # Business name in local language

  "latitude": float,  # -90 to 90
  "longitude": float,  # -180 to 180
  # OR
  "full_address": str,  # Complete address including city/country/postal code
  
  # Tracking (optional but encouraged)
  place_id: str, # Your internal stable identifier for the place to be used to join on later

  # Optional but increase accuracy
  "type": str,  # Primary category of the place

  # Address subparts
  "street": str,
  "house": str,  # Building number
  "city": str,
  "state": str,
  "postalCode": str,
  
  # Location metadata
  "wkt_geometry": str,  # Alternative to lat/lon, uses (lon, lat) order
  "country": str,
  "country_code": str,  # ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 (e.g., "US", "GB")
  
  # Enrichment hints
  "website": str,  # Will be validated/corrected. Better to provide even if wrong
  "phone": str,  # International format preferred
  "type": str,  # Primary category (helps disambiguation)
  "opening_hours": dict,
}
```

## Provide a stable identifier with place_id
We encourage you to provide a stable identifier for the place with the `place_id` field. A place_id is returned with every API call as the place's primary key.

If you don't provide a `place_id`, we will automatically generate a UUID for you.


## Field Priority

**Critical for accuracy:**
1. `name` (required)
2. `latitude` + `longitude` OR `full_address`
3. `full_address` (when combined with coordinates)

**Helpful for disambiguation:**
- `type` - Essential for places like "Hotel Bar" vs "Hotel"
- `website` - Preferred source even if incorrect
- `country_code` - Inferred from coordinates if not provided

## Examples

### Minimal (Name + Coordinates)
```json
{
  "name": "Joes Pizza",
  "latitude": 40.7359,
  "longitude": -73.9911
}
```

### Minimal (Name + Address)
```json
{
  "name": "Joes Pizza",
  "full_address": "7 Carmine St, New York, NY 10014"
}
```

### Recommended (All key fields)
```json
{
  "name": "Joes Pizza",
  "latitude": 40.7359,
  "longitude": -73.9911,
  "full_address": "7 Carmine St, New York, NY 10014",
  "type": "restaurant",
  "country_code": "US"
}
```

### Complete (Maximum accuracy)
```json
{
  "id": "place_123",
  "name": "Joes Pizza",
  "latitude": 40.7359,
  "longitude": -73.9911,
  "full_address": "7 Carmine St, New York, NY 10014",
  "street": "Carmine St",
  "house": "7",
  "city": "New York",
  "state": "NY",
  "postalCode": "10014",
  "country": "United States",

  "type": "restaurant",
  "website": "http://www.joespizzanyc.com",
  "phone": "+12122555803"
}
```

## Confidence Scores

Confidence scores indicate how reliable an enrichment result is based on the quality and quantity of sources found.

```python
class ConfidenceScore(str, Enum):
    VERY_HIGH = "VERY_HIGH"
    HIGH = "HIGH"
    MEDIUM = "MEDIUM"
    LOW = "LOW"
    NONE = "NONE"
```

### Confidence Levels

| Level | Description | When Used |
|-------|-------------|-----------|
| `VERY_HIGH` | Extremely reliable | Multiple authoritative sources, recent data, high source quality |
| `HIGH` | Very reliable | Strong evidence from credible sources, good recency |
| `MEDIUM` | Moderately reliable | Reasonable evidence with some uncertainty or older sources |
| `LOW` | Less reliable | Ambiguous, conflicting, or weak signals |
| `NONE` | No confidence | No reliable sources found or unable to determine |

### Best Practices

- **VERY_HIGH/HIGH**: Safe to use directly in production
- **MEDIUM**: Generally reliable, consider validation for critical use cases
- **LOW**: Use with caution, may require manual review
- **NONE**: No reliable data found, consider alternative sources

---

## Open/Closed Status

```python
class OpenClosedStatus(str, Enum):
    NO_INTERNET_PRESENCE = "No Internet Presence"
    OPEN = "Open"
    CLOSED = "Closed"
    TEMPORARILY_CLOSED = "Temporarily Closed"
```

### Status Definitions

- **Open**: Recent, credible evidence the business is operating
- **Closed**: Explicit closure signals from credible sources
- **Temporarily Closed**: Business appears temporarily closed but may reopen
- **No Internet Presence**: No credible reference for the exact name with plausible location context
