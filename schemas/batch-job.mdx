## Status Lifecycle

The batch status follows this lifecycle:

1. **`pending`** - Batch is queued but not yet started
2. **`queued`** - Batch is in the processing queue
3. **`in_progress`** - Batch is currently being processed
4. **`completed`** - All jobs in the batch are finished (successfully or failed)
5. **`failed`** - Batch encountered critical errors and cannot continue

## Usage in API Responses

This model is returned by:

- `GET /place_enrichment/batches` - List all batches
- `GET /place_enrichment/batches/{batch_id}` - Get specific batch status
- `POST /place_enrichment/batches` - Submit new batch (in response)
